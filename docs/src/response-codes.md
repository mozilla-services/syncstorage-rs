## Infrastructure-produced Response Codes

These response codes are generated by the Mozilla Services infrastructure,
particularly the load balancers. They will not occur in self-hosting scenarios.

If you observe these values in a 503 response in Sync logs, please file an issue:
[Syncstorage-rs GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncstorage-rs/issues).

These codes are temporarily a mixture of strings and numeric values. This
inconsistency may be resolved at a future date.
