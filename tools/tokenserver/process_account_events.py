Script to process account-related events from an SQS queue.

This script polls an SQS queue for events indicating activity on an upstream
account, as documented here:

  https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/blob/master/docs/service_notifications.md

The following event types are currently supported:

  * "delete":  the account was deleted; we mark their records as retired
               so they'll be cleaned up by our garbage-collection process.

  * "reset":   the account password was reset; we update our copy of their
               generation number to disconnect other devices.

  * "passwordChange":  the account password was changed; we update our copy
                       of their generation number to disconnect other devices.

Note that this is a purely optional administrative task, highly specific to
Mozilla's internal Firefox-Accounts-supported deployment.

    When the FxA server sends us an update to the user's generation
    number, we want to update our high-water-mark in the DB in order to
    immediately lock out disconnected devices.  However, since we don't
    know the new value of the client state that goes with it, we can't just
    record the new generation number in the DB.  If we did, the first
    device that tried to sync with the new generation number would appear
    to have an incorrect client state value, and would be rejected.

    Instead, we take advantage of the fact that it's a timestamp, and write
    it into the DB at one millisecond less than its current value.  This
    ensures that we lock out any devices with an older generation number
    while avoiding errors with client state handling.

    This does leave a tiny edge-case where we can fail to lock out older
    devices, if the generation number changes twice in less than a
    millisecond.  This is acceptably unlikely in practice, and we'll recover
    as soon as we see an updated generation number as part of a sync.
