  hashed_fxa_uid:
    type: string
    # yamllint disable
    description: >
      User identifier. Uses `hashed_fxa_uid` for accurate count of sync actions.
      Used to determine which user has initiated sync activity.
      This is the Firefox Accounts (FxA) User Identifier (UID) value passed through
      a SHA-256 hash to render a value that is unique, but ensures the privacy of the original UID.
      A single user could make numerous sync actions in a given time
      and this id is required to ensure only a single count of daily active use
      is made, given a number of actions. Sync_id is not used due to possibility
      of new keys being generated during resets or timeouts, whenever encryption
      keys change.
